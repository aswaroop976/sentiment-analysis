On 2nd part I'm more conflicted. Yeah action is pretty fun, but that last part with Raphtalia I found rather stupid. Like, Kyo somehow can deny specific person to teleport with dragon hourglass, just out of nowhere, he can do it. Feels like rather lazy attempt to create tension, especially with villains in this season being rather weak and uninteresting so far. And plus, come on, I know that Raphtalia will be ok in the end, characters like her don't die and don't suffer irreversible consequences, so no, season 2 of Rise of the Shield Hero, bait- failed.

I love [Kizuna](https://i.imgur.com/iMnxuUN.png) and [Rishia's reactions](https://i.imgur.com/rxOMfcN.jpg) to Merchant Naofumi. It's definitely a side of him they've never seen before especially Rishia. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, the SP recovery potion is the perfect item to sell since it looks like it's in demand to the Spirit people like Glass who can't recover their SP any other way. Naofumi has really become a veteran merchant, [have a bunch of spirits try it out for free](https://i.imgur.com/0n5Vazi.jpg), sell it at a low price, [and then once the demand is clearly high](https://i.imgur.com/hbQAZHd.jpg), instead of just jacking up the price [put it up on auction](https://i.imgur.com/X1tZL2G.png) and watch them go crazy with their bids. \\n\\nA little bit of market manipulation helps too! [After Kizuna trips Rishia](https://i.imgur.com/s6b0bqT.jpg) and they so happen to have [only one SP recovery potion left](https://i.imgur.com/uEUftiL.jpg), that's when the prices really go crazy. [They ended up with four gold coins!](https://i.imgur.com/i8BKBwZ.jpg) That was such a dirty play but hey! Gotta do what they have to do to survive in this new world! \\n\\nNow that the money problem has been sorted out, [they can blend in better with new clothes](https://i.imgur.com/aoODtRs.jpg).

[Raph playing in the snow](https://i.imgur.com/3goNu0c.jpg) and [her face when she almost burnt her dango](https://i.imgur.com/B8eAf6N.jpg) is just too cute! <3\\n\\nTime to head to the Dragon Hourglass though and it looks like [that pretty boy earlier set up a trap for them.](https://i.imgur.com/afCSyOC.png) What's worse is that it's pretty clear that he's working with Kyo in trying to use the Dragon Hourglass so that non-heroes can teleport from it too. \\n\\nI wasn't 100% sure when this arc started because of that one glaring change [but seeing how they fixed it with that final scene](https://i.imgur.com/6kdExUl.png) has given me back a lot of hope in this arc! The way they separated Naofumi and Raphtalia in this arc is so much worse [since Naofumi got to see it happen right in front of him](https://i.imgur.com/aKJeanh.png) and [he was powerless to do anything](https://i.imgur.com/kLYvFF2.jpg) as well as knowing that Kyo is responsible for it.

So in that world, the types of demihumans are different too, and they are divided into: [The Grass People,](https://i.imgur.com/ETO5yVo.png) which are basically elves. [The Jewel people](https://i.imgur.com/wOEh7dI.png) which Therese is part of. And[ the Spirit People,](https://i.imgur.com/lWexE1f.png) which  Glass is part of. \\n\\nAs not only the culture but also [the currency](https://i.imgur.com/GPaySPh.png) of that country resembles the old Japanese one I guess people have been getting isekaid there from Japan for a long ass time.  \\n\\nThose[ hungry Raphtalia scenes](https://imgur.com/a/WOpoAVV) were so cute.

Which is all the more relevant when we\\'re they\\'re at is like feudal Japan.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWe finally learn what races Therese and Glass are, races that only exist in that world, and why Glass is so powerful since she\\'s a Spirit person. I guess she\\'s kind of like a Japanese Yokai, except more alive?\\r  \\n\\r  \\nNaofumi back to doing what he does best, being a salesman and making money through supply and demand, although this was probably Naofumi at his most hammy. And basically engineering Rishia\\'s klutziness to help sell their product. Poor girl. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nI guess it makes sense that since Naofumi even being in there isn\\'t part of the game or a \"bug\" so two people from other games using items on each other would have vastly different effects. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nWell, new location means new clothes, and the group (other than Kizuna) wear their new Japanese-style outfits quite well. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nRaphtalia asking who looked the best in their new outfits and, of course, Naofumi just talks about the stats. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nWell, no surprise that they\\'re attempts to get a Dragon Hourglass to warp them to where Kizuna was summoned would turn into a trap, but luckily now that Raphtalia has a sword that actually fits her new size she can actually fight again. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nThis Kazuki guy seems as arrogant and cocky as Kyo, but that makes him perfect for Naofumi\\'s sass. Of course the sass stops when it turns out Kyo had orchestrated all of this to have Raphtalia all to himself since she\\'s not able to warp with them, leaving her alone against Kazuki and a bunch of guards with the prospect of Kyo experimenting on and abusing her. I know Raphtalia will fight to her last breath, but the prospects don\\'t look good for her.', 'If only this season would have started with this arc instead of tortoise bullshit...\\n\\n  \\nAt least it feels a lot better and interesting, could have done some episode 0 exposition dump and skipped right to this.', 'So they corrected things from the last episode.

On 2nd part I\\'m more conflicted. Yeah action is pretty fun, but that last part with Raphtalia I found rather stupid. Like, Kyo somehow can deny specific person to teleport with dragon hourglass, just out of nowhere, he can do it. Feels like rather lazy attempt to create tension, especially with villains in this season being rather weak and uninteresting so far. And plus, come on, I know that Raphtalia will be ok in the end, characters like her don\\'t die and don\\'t suffer irreversible consequences, so no, season 2 of Rise of the Shield Hero, bait- failed. I\\'m interested to see what\\'s next tho, and outside of what I mentioned- I thought the episode was solid. , *Absolutely ruthless* business practices that auction was. Could give some big (IRL) companies a run for their money. , Yay for being a merchant again, I guess. What a scammer lol. \\n\\nOh boy, another blatantly asshole/cocky seeming character. Haven\\'t had enough of those, eh? \\n\\nThis season still is just me. Wednesdays, the anime day of \"meh\" for me.\\n\\nGuess that\\'s one way to have Raphtalia split up from them. , I strongly enjoy Kizuna’s character. , That ending though, hope they don\\'t make Raphtalia go through what she already did as a slave.\\n\\nNaofumi gonna be angry and depressed again , Alot of improvement in the last 2 episodes I have to say , [removed] , ###Stitches!\\n\\n* [Smol Raphtalia](https://i.imgur.com/M5d4n0q.jpg)\\n\\n* [Shield Hero Party Japanese Armor Ver. ](https://i.imgur.com/qQa2mMs.jpg)\\n\\n\\n\\nWelp, if they want to get around in this new world [they\\'re going to need money](https://i.imgur.com/bhjdv3V.png) so I guess it\\'s Merchant Naofumi\\'s time to shine and [start selling his wares](https://i.imgur.com/jG7vb1U.jpg) with [poster girl Raphtalia](https://i.imgur.com/ZdYx5KA.jpg) attracting all of the curious customers. I love [Kizuna](https://i.imgur.com/iMnxuUN.png) and [Rishia\\'s reactions](https://i.imgur.com/rxOMfcN.jpg) to Merchant Naofumi. It\\'s definitely a side of him they\\'ve never seen before especially Rishia. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, the SP recovery potion is the perfect item to sell since it looks like it\\'s in demand to the Spirit people like Glass who can\\'t recover their SP any other way. Naofumi has really become a veteran merchant, [have a bunch of spirits try it out for free](https://i.imgur.com/0n5Vazi.jpg), sell it at a low price, [and then once the demand is clearly high](https://i.imgur.com/hbQAZHd.jpg), instead of just jacking up the price [put it up on auction](https://i.imgur.com/X1tZL2G.png) and watch them go crazy with their bids. \\n\\nA little bit of market manipulation helps too! [After Kizuna trips Rishia](https://i.imgur.com/s6b0bqT.jpg) and they so happen to have [only one SP recovery potion left](https://i.imgur.com/uEUftiL.jpg), that\\'s when the prices really go crazy. [They ended up with four gold coins!](https://i.imgur.com/i8BKBwZ.jpg) That was such a dirty play but hey!

[Raph playing in the snow](https://i.imgur.com/3goNu0c.jpg) and [her face when she almost burnt her dango](https://i.imgur.com/B8eAf6N.jpg) is just too cute! <3\\n\\nTime to head to the Dragon Hourglass though and it looks like [that pretty boy earlier set up a trap for them.](https://i.imgur.com/afCSyOC.png) What\\'s worse is that it\\'s pretty clear that he\\'s working with Kyo in trying to use the Dragon Hourglass so that non-heroes can teleport from it too. \\n\\nI wasn\\'t 100% sure when this arc started because of that one glaring change [but seeing how they fixed it with that final scene](https://i.imgur.com/6kdExUl.png) has given me back a lot of hope in this arc! The way they separated Naofumi and Raphtalia in this arc is so much worse [since Naofumi got to see it happen right in front of him](https://i.imgur.com/aKJeanh.png) and [he was powerless to do anything](https://i.imgur.com/kLYvFF2.jpg) as well as knowing that Kyo is responsible for it. I can\\'t wait for next week\\'s episode! , [who tf gave them juuls for a potion](https://imgur.com/a/aKXvKEq) , The merchanting segments of this show really makes me want a *Spice and Wolf* season 3. , I see , shield hero is rising again , I wonder if Naofumi will [have the UI of his shield being glitchy](https://i.imgur.com/VnnErSY.png) as long he is in that world or if it would get better as he levels up? \\n\\nSo in that world, the Hourglass can be used for fast travel. So in that world, the types of demihumans are different too, and they are divided into: [The Grass People,](https://i.imgur.com/ETO5yVo.png) which are basically elves. [The Jewel people](https://i.imgur.com/wOEh7dI.png) which Therese is part of. And[ the Spirit People,](https://i.imgur.com/lWexE1f.png) which  Glass is part of. \\n\\nAs not only the culture but also [the currency](https://i.imgur.com/GPaySPh.png) of that country resembles the old Japanese one I guess people have been getting isekaid there from Japan for a long ass time.  \\n\\nThose[ hungry Raphtalia scenes](https://imgur.com/a/WOpoAVV) were so cute.

MORE FOOD! , Was is just me or was the music exceptionally good this episode? It\\'s crazy how much more emotion/intensity it brought to the action/plot , \"you fake-ass wannabe kyo!\" , I\\'m enjoying the season more now that\\'s it\\'s not as focused on that green hair dumbass , If there\\'s one thing Raphtalia can appreciate about being a loli again, it\\'s getting princess carried, doted on, and in general being super adorable.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIt must be nice for Naofumi to have a fellow Japanese person he can actually talk to and get along with, and whom understands his references to their homeland and fantasy conventions (I forgot elves aren\\'t a thing in this universe). Which is all the more relevant when we\\'re they\\'re at is like feudal Japan.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWe finally learn what races Therese and Glass are, races that only exist in that world, and why Glass is so powerful since she\\'s a Spirit person. I guess she\\'s kind of like a Japanese Yokai, except more alive?\\r  \\n\\r  \\nNaofumi back to doing what he does best, being a salesman and making money through supply and demand, although this was probably Naofumi at his most hammy. And basically engineering Rishia\\'s klutziness to help sell their product. Poor girl. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nI guess it makes sense that since Naofumi even being in there isn\\'t part of the game or a \"bug\" so two people from other games using items on each other would have vastly different effects. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nWell, new location means new clothes, and the group (other than Kizuna) wear their new Japanese-style outfits quite well. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nRaphtalia asking who looked the best in their new outfits and, of course, Naofumi just talks about the stats. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nWell, no surprise that they\\'re attempts to get a Dragon Hourglass to warp them to where Kizuna was summoned would turn into a trap, but luckily now that Raphtalia has a sword that actually fits her new size she can actually fight again. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nThis Kazuki guy seems as arrogant and cocky as Kyo, but that makes him perfect for Naofumi\\'s sass. Of course the sass stops when it turns out Kyo had orchestrated all of this to have Raphtalia all to himself since she\\'s not able to warp with them, leaving her alone against Kazuki and a bunch of guards with the prospect of Kyo experimenting on and abusing her. I know Raphtalia will fight to her last breath, but the prospects don\\'t look good for her. , If only this season would have started with this arc instead of tortoise bullshit...\\n\\n  \\nAt least it feels a lot better and interesting, could have done some episode 0 exposition dump and skipped right to this. , So they corrected things from the last episode. Will see if this gonna make it better or worse. , Damn the OST is God-tier. Can\\'t say the same for the animation though...[Meteor Shield](https://i.imgur.com/RhJMQ0g.png) side effect : drops meteor on animation quality.\\n\\nAlso LN readers, y\\'all happy now? ಥ﹏ಥ , Nooooo Raphtalia better not be leveled up next time we see her. I need to see smol Raphtalia and Filo together on-screen. , Man just when I thought there wasn’t someone as unlikeable as Kyo, this Kazaki fella comes along. Both of these dudes need to get whooped…\\n\\nThey’ve  got no Filo and now Raphtalia is gonna get captured. I really hope they save her before Kyo does any real damage. Who knows what this creep has planned… \\n\\nAnyways, all that aside I kind of like the aesthetic of this new world. I dig this quasi-Asian look they’ve got going on. It’s also kinda interesting how different this world works, like how they can use that hourglass to transport or how items in this world can boost Naofumi’s XP. \\n\\nAnyways, looking forward to next week. Hopefully they don’t face anymore setbacks. , This (and last) episode was a big improvement plot-wise from the previous arc. Even though it has its flaws, I’m a lot more interested in finding out what happens from here on out than I was during the spirit tortoise escapade. , #Its time for Rising of the Japanese Shield Hero~  \\n\\n[](#oilup)  \\n\\nSmoltalia getting carried heals the soul.  \\n\\nWe are going to the land Hunt Loli is from?  This will be fun.  \\n\\nOh were going to the country that lucked her up but we can TP with the hourglass nice.  \\n\\n2 Days to the capitol gotta make money to get there too oh boy...  \\n\\nOh god info overdump.  \\n\\nJapan country with clothes too.  We have grass people, elves, gem people, spirit people.  \\n\\nSheild Bro gonna make money exploting spirit race weaknesses hahah.  \\n\\nRaph being hungry heals the soul.  \\n\\nIts time for Shield Bros merchant skills to pay off.  \\n\\nSo does this world have beast people like Raph?  Hm i wonder what all the races here are.  \\n\\nOh no no XP for heroes issue from the old world.  \\n\\nWait the items from the diff worlds dont match up either?  Oh shit this is interesting.  \\n\\nWAIT IS SHIELD BRO MAKING HIS PRODUCT SCARCE TO MAKE HUGE PROFITS HAHAHHAH!  \\n\\nJAPANESE SHIELD BRO! ALL NEW ARMOR FOR THE GANG!  \\n\\nA mage figured out how to use the hourglass?  Is it book hero?  No whose this guy?  \\n\\nEveryone is happy to see snow, did it snow in the old world?  \\n\\n2 defenders and 2 low level swordsmen... were in shit arnt we?  \\n\\nSo we use the blizzard to get inside un noticed?  Will this work though...  \\n\\nOh shit we got trapped... time to bust outta here with force.  \\n\\nSo her hunting sword can hurt other stuff just not people so she has to use enviroment to do stuff, thats neat.  \\n\\nWe made it to the real dragonglass but the asshat from before is there.  Whats going on?  He knows Kyo?  Ahhhh.  \\n\\n\"Fake ass wannabe Kyo\" what an insult hahahaha.  The gang is all here lets go!  \\n\\nOh no Raph cant TP?  Kyo us splitting the party?  \\n\\nRaph is staying behind... shit... this isnt good...   Maybe she can figure something out on her own.  \\n\\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~ , well that ending bit is certainly concerning... right now i don\\'t see a way for them to save her, and that she likely gets saved by someone else\\n\\nthe merchant part of it was pretty good, Naofumi\\'s experience paid of there for sure , Has the series been improving? I dropped off at ep 3 and am waiting for it to simmer. , Oh dear it\\'s going to be Rishia highlights for multiple episodes now isn\\'t it. This is where I drop off until the season is done. , lmao are they expecting us to watch this without Raphtalia and Filo\\n\\nThis is gonna be so annoying to watch until the eventual reunion , What happened to this season ? , Someone just tell me just this much….nothing bad happens to Raphtalia right? Don’t care if I get spoiled (I ain’t invested in this show tbh, just want to see Raphtalia end up happy after all the shit she went through prior to meeting Naofumi) , Honestly I hope raphtalia gets hit hard and experimented on and doesn’t bullshit plot armour through this , At least it\\'s better than Spirit Tortoise arc💀 , Bruh I thought we were done with the kyo dudo. , At this point the only good thing about this show is the OSTs... everything else falls flat\\n\\nBut I guess its still an improvement compared to the previous arc , I like how they wear masks when doing the auctions, presumably to hide their identity. But Raphtalia doesn\\'t wear a mask, and still accompanies them around town, making their identity totally obvious. , It\\'s crazy how good this show has gotten!! , I liked this part in manga. It was great to see him go back to his roots. Sad that it was only half an ep but still. And now raphtalia is kidnapped, he losing her now. , SHIMATTA!! , So did...Kyo also go to the labyrinth? Was he there and we just didn\\'t know? , Loved seen naofumi being a merchant, what a quirky mothefucker, also what a great way to make the separation scene. , Damn, Raphtalia getting left behind! Although it did make me chuckle that Naofumi\\'s reaction to her being left behind seemed way more intense than his reaction of Filo being missing. SMH.\\n\\nI like our new girl a lot, and will be interesting when she learns that Glass and the others are trying to destroy Naofumi\\'s world. , So, four or five episodes left, I hope we finally get to see where Filo is and nothing bad happens to both her and Raphtalia. , Raphtalia!!! My heart ❤️ , I see merchant Naofumi is using his Muscle onisan voice.\\n\\nSIDE CHESTO , I guess the studio decide to do it this way to have more dramatic effect on the separation.\\n\\nNaofumi keeps saying that Rapthalia and Rishia are not high levels enough to fight humans but Rapthalia just plowed her way through a bunch of guards to make an opening. Rishia simply pushed the 2 well-armed female guards like they were nothing. lol\\n\\nThere were a few times that the animation gets clunky but overall a good episode. , As much as i didn\\'t like the third op comparatively,it the new version of OP3 since the last two episodes has grown on me.\\n\\nI like the rap part and infact the whole op.\\n\\nAlso,The Shield Hero is Rising,ladies and gentlemen. , this is alot better than the Turtle arc , Welp, I guess the rage-shield is gonna be back, huh. Last time he \"felt no rage\" towards Kyo so he didn\\'t get to use it, but I\\'m not sure the asshole is gonna get lucky again. , This show got so much better. , That was one damn long teleport wind up. They were still there a few mins after activating the skill lol. , Hahahaha the way Rishia simply tackles through the 2 guard girls like they arent even there. Its funny but in a bad way , Wow these last two episodes are so much better then the Turtle nonesense. I actually an now enjoying the show instead of just forcing myself to watch it. Hope this trend continues , It looks bad for Raph, but I really doubt they’ll bump her off and lose what little audience they have. , so i\\'m wondering if book hero made it so non-humans couldn\\'t teleport. though the fact that someone can stop a teleport on purpose is kinda strong. does that mean filo didn\\'t even come to this world? or that Kyo is holding her hostage. , Everyone gather for the mandatory annual [eye test!](https://i.imgur.com/YnPkAx8.jpg)\\n\\nThe music continues to be absolutely amazing. , Second episode of the new arc and it\\'s already 10 times better than the turtle island arc. I could see there were some budget moments though but the plot is interesting yet again. , ngl, Kyo feels a lot like Myne. They’re not really the same, but the way they act reminds me of it. , Can\\'t believe I got more enjoyment out of Naofumi willing and dealing some poor fools into magic snake oil than him fighting a whole ass turtle mountain god but oh well XD\\n\\nHonestly liking things so much more now just need to know if Filo is okay now (Probably held by Kyo for dick moves) , The merchant part of the episode really solidified my opinion that this show\\'s at its best when the characters are just side questing. , Raphtalia: \"Which one of us looks the best Naofumi?\" \\r  \\n\\r  \\nNaofumi: \"Me obviously\" , The first season was so good… not that this episode was terrible, but it doesn’t even compare to S1… that’s a little disappointing. Also, Kyo is just annoying. Can we get a good villain please? , [removed] , They took what could have been a cool moment for naofumi and turned it into another case of “haha jebaited by villain” \\n\\nWhy does this season seem so contrived lol , \"Hey Shield Dumbass!\"\\nMight be a bit controversial to say, but I enjoy Kyo much more than Naofumi.\\nWatching Kyo just dunk on and sass Naofumi is pretty entertaining ngl. , [removed] , Generally like the way this is going. Thumbs up show. It was good seeing Raphtalia in chibi form again, fun while it lasted, worth the change. , So now it\\'s separating Raphtalia from Naofumi to get back on track with the LN and manga? , You know what? I\\'ve turned completely around with this change. Having Raph separated from Naofumi right in front of him and knowing that Kyou is the one responsible for it? It makes the entire separation anxiety so much worse for Naofumi and Raph. It also gives us so much more reason to hate Kyo. I\\'m now 100% on board with this! , Okay that\\'s how they get seaparated, tbh this is way harder on Naofumi as he sees her dissapear in front of him , LN readers can you spoil me for the next maybe 10 episodes? , > they sure did plow through them like dominoes lol.\\n\\nIt\\'s probably QUALITY issues hampering actually showing action but it was rather funny seeing Rishia just push her way through that guy\\'s two *armed* guards - they didn\\'t even have their spears pointed at Rishia when she charged them... , Yeah, I was kind of surprised how easy that ended up being. Granted, Raphtalia still has her training and now has a weapon that fits her new body, but I\\'m surprised Naofumi\\'s skills with his shield still worked. , Despite the issues with quality, I think this episode is 10x more watchable than any of the episodes from the tortoise arc , >I enjoyed this episode but something feels off, they\\'ve adapted everything that needed to be adapted and explained a lot of stuff but it felt really fast.\\n\\nYeah, there\\'s definitely that feeling of things being rushed though its better than the Turtle Arc. Did they explain how Raphtalia got cut off? Maybe its something they figure out later. , It is a pretty strong cliffhanger having Naofumi forced to leave Smol!Raphtalia behind as she has to take down a bunch of people by herself. But at least she has a weapon she can actually wield now.\\n\\nThe new outfits were great. I love how Raphtalia was trying to get him to say she looked the best and all Naofumi could think of was about the stats of their clothes. , The speedrun heroe , Yeah, it felt extremely out of nowhere. I literally came to this thread because I’m confused af about it and thought I missed something. , So in general the Rahptalia thing seems just to be to go back to what the LN Is like , >characters like her don\\'t die and don\\'t suffer irreversible consequences,\\n\\nHaha, lol , If Wednesday’s your meh day, you’re clearly missing out on watching deaimon (or however its spelled). Deffo check it out if you haven’t already , You\\'re absolutely right. It\\'s quite ad considering that the first season was great. , I haven\\'t seen somebody weaponize a fishing pole this well since HxH and JoJo\\'s. , Likewise, she adds a lot of energy to the party and has her own ideas and agency. , she\\'s the big reason why people love this arc , It\\'s kinda funny how the mc\\'s universe has the conventional sword, spear, shield, bow, and then all of the other universes have - fishing pole. fan. book. blue rock. , She\\'s cute, capable, can hold her own alongside Naofumi...she\\'s everything the Three Stooges are not.\\n\\nShe actually kind of reminds me of Melty. , Pace is still a bit screwy but things are definitely improving. , I love it when Naofumi goes from shield hero to capitalist hero. , > Focusing on Raphtalia throughout this episode was a good decision as it foreshadowed their separation instead of making it come out of nowhere.\\n\\nPlus, it\\'s also just a good decision all round. Naofumi himself is much more interesting when he\\'s interacting with Raphtalia. , I feel like Naofumi would go back and get a job in sales and possibly child rearing. , I appreciate the stitches! , > Smol Raphtalia\\n\\nWhat a well-rendered portrait of everyone\\'s favourite little demihuman. Looks like a poster. , The power of artificial scarcity. , Y\\'know those not-silvers look kinda *sus* , A new Spice and Wolf anime was announced, though it\\'s unsure what exactly it is. , You are speakin absolute facts man. , This episode was peak Naofumi with him back in salesman mode, taking care of Raphtalia, trash-talking the villain, and in general trying to struggle to figure out how to get out of the mess he\\'s in. , Loved the first season. Almost dropped this season. I hope it gets better, because even these latest episodes are pretty weak. , Lol grass people but Glass is not one of em. \\n\\nDamn getting isekaied so much they change the culture, well I guess it was the same in Naofumi\\'s world too. And another anime that\\'s airing has the same impact by isekaied people. \\n\\nRaphtalia is eyeing the food even more than Filo does. \\n\\nLol Risha\\'s mask is already making a face that says \"Fuee\" \\n\\nI guess everyone loves Tanuki girls no matter the world. \\n\\nLol Naofumi is a man of sheer dedication, he only cares about the stats of his clothes not how they look. \\n\\n>\\tAs the episode is titled “A Parting in the Snow.” to me that was the most nerve-wracking snow play ever\\n\\nWas that a CSM reference? Honestly they should\\'ve just cut down that barrier/door on the first try. \\n\\nThat ambush stitch looks sick. \\n\\nYea I guess we\\'re following the main route now. \\n\\n[Btw do you have these 2 stitches of the town and Raphtalia? Thanks ](https://imgur.com/a/iwfiuDT/) , >I wonder if Naofumi will have the UI of his shield being glitchy as long he is in that world or if it would get better as he levels up?\\n\\nWTF is his location Melromarc? , the cutest fatass , Smol!Raphtalia is the most adorable Raphtalia. \\n\\nI also love how she tried to ask Naofumi for who looked the best in their new outfits and he just talked about the stats. , Kevin Penkim simply. , Perhaps you’re referring to [autoroll](https://youtu.be/36qIE4P92hY)? It’s one of the best tracks from their ost that they play at the best times. That and ohkami. These songs were in s1 as well , Not just for the action scenes - i noticed that even the music for when they were escaping the prison grounds and the comfortable eating scenes was fantastic as well. , Naofumi\\'s trash talk is back in full force. , That good ol\\' savagery. , In the LN, Naofumi calls him Trash II , >If only this season would have started with this arc instead of tortoise bullshit...\\n\\nYeah, but that would have been even more jarring. , This definitely feels like a step up from the Spirit Tortoise arc.\\n\\nKizuna is more likeable and compelling than Ost (even if we\\'re exchanging a sexy HanaKana for a loli Miyu Tomita), Raphtalia\\'s cuteness is back in full force, and Rishia feels more tolerable than ever. It also feels like more of the old show in terms of feel/vibe. , Then people would be like why is this guy bad \\n\\nwhat did naofumi and co do\\n\\nWho the heck is kyo \\n\\nhow the hell did naofumi end up in a random world , A good example of source readers being too quick to judge - the separation still happened, just in a different way. It hurts way more this way. , I have to admit that this arc is really selling me on Smol!Raphtalia again because of how absolutely adorable she is. \\n\\nFilo would\\'ve probably loved to have been in that snowball fight. , I don\\'t want that! , I love how even Naofumi called him out at being discount Kyo. He and his female bodyguards didn\\'t even accomplish anything. \\n\\nKyo really knows how to stick it to Naofumi by messing with the things most important to him. \\n\\nIt is an Isekai staple to find yourself in basically feudal Japan at some point, even if Naofumi had to pull a double Isekai to end up there. Although it\\'s not often you see other races living in said feudal Japan setting. \\n\\nNaofumi\\'s presence in the game is like a bug so I guess it makes sense items between two people from different games would have different effects. , The magic seems so much more interesting in this world. That and the Jewel and Spirit races are so much more imaginative and interesting than the regular fantasy choices.\\n\\nThis entire arc seems almost overflowing with imagination compared to the previous, extremely generic jrpg world that the show began on. , I\\'m not sure I see Raphtalia being able to fight them all off by herself, but I\\'d hate to think of what Kyo would do to her...\\n\\nI love how Naofumi became so hammy as a salesperson. Like he was really getting into character. , The current arc is indeed better and more enjoyable than the last one. This episode was more about exploration, which I really enjoyed in the first season. , We do get Kizuna to help us through their absence. , Idk man everything feels so contrived now lol , She should be fine but a lot of things this season are anime original so it makes even source readers a bit unsure of how things will go. , I actually hope for the exact opposite.\\nWe already hate the new villain for how unlikeable he is, him \"experimenting\" on Raphtalia just sounds like unneeded torture porn to me. There\\'s better ways to make villains villains, instead of just going the SAO route of \"he molests and tortures girls\". , Raphtalia turned into a child remember. That is her disguise. , Yes, it went from a 3/10 to a solid 4/10, if not higher. , They did see Filo profile on the status screen, just a bit corrupted.  And yes, Kyo is a pretty big deal as you will see later. , Sorry, your comment has been removed.\\r\\n\\r\\n-  This belongs in the Source Corner at the top of this thread.

Don\\'t know the rules? Read them )[**^(here)**](/r/anime/wiki/rules)^. , Go over to the shield hero subreddit you\\'ll have better chances there , >Having Raph separated from Naofumi right in front of him and knowing that Kyou is the one responsible for it\\n\\nThis happened in the LN as well... , The sacred timeline is restored , At that point just read it yourself, or use whatever small % of the story you can find on the wiki , I thought Shooting Star Shield (Ryusei Tate) was a high level skill, but turns out Naofumi can use it when his level is in 30s? , At this point I kinda assume that if you aren\\'t a hero or attached to a heroes party you are basically at level 0 and having that status gives you a significant boost even when you are low level. You are expected to fight monster waves after all. , Well, they did spend a fair amount of time buffing up with magic items. That probably made them stronger than they themselves anticipated. , Agree tort arc was utter dog shit imo , This is also imo the best arc in the series , > Did they explain how Raphtalia got cut off?\\n\\nI mean, Kyo can manipulate the teleport system to force it to accept people who aren\\'t heroes, so presumably it\\'s no big deal for him to manipulate it to kick someone out. It\\'s possible that they might go into it, but I don\\'t see how knowing the mechanics would make much difference. , I was wondering why she was the only one who wasn\\'t teleported but it sounds like Kyo engineered it that way deliberately? Somehow? \\n\\nMaybe it had something to do with her level being reset? , They should have rushed the Turtle Arc and slowed down this arc. But they did the opposite. , She may have lower stats but she still has her muscle memory. She got big quick too the first time around, I just really don\\'t want Kyo going after her. Well, we asked for it and it looks like we\\'re getting pissed Naofumi again...be careful what you wish for , There’s a reason they call it mid-hero these days lol , When the season started and I was picking what to watch, I was pretty damn hyped for shieldbro, but honestly I\\'m loving Deaimon a lot more for my Wednesdays , >HxH\\n\\nThen the episode had great timing, I guess. , It\\'s kind of ridiculous how they keep grabbing the line, that\\'s gonna be like a guitar string since it\\'s a weapon as well. , >she\\'s the big reason why people love this arc\\n\\nIn the manga, I assume. The anime is still on very thin ice for me. , He would be the owner of a minimarket/daycare hybrid. And somehow Raphtalia will be even younger as he would be level one again in his world. , There\\'s nothing artificial about it. Those SP potions literally don\\'t exist in that world. , It just feels like there\\'s no tension anymore. I don\\'t know if it\\'s something with the pacing, the writing, or just the show in general, but even though I\\'ve enjoyed the last two episodes quite a bit more than the others of this season, it doesn\\'t feel like there\\'s any risk to the party anymore. , >[Btw do you have these 2 stitches of the town and Raphtalia? Thanks](https://imgur.com/a/iwfiuDT/)\\n\\n\\n[Here you have them.](https://imgur.com/a/pmECRg4) Six images in total. The only difference with the last two is a total change.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\n    I\\'m just reposting the ones from last week as its comment thread was erased: \\n\\n>Btw do you have [these stitches of Kizuna](https://imgur.com/a/w7qRer0/) and[ the group? Thanks.](https://imgur.com/a/Pb6ubVX/)\\n\\n[Here you have them.](https://imgur.com/a/wa2NkmY) Fifteen images in total. The first two sets just have a small tone variation. , that\\'s the Dragon Hourglass he is registered to , I guess that because he is in another world and his level got reset, his shield also reset to his default location. , This Dude is a whole new energy , Absolutely yes, this was one of the tracks that was hitting hard hahah. Auroroll is 🔥🔥🔥 , I feel that they could have written one of those in-media-res openings with the ending of the final battle with Kyo inside the turtle, then have the characters reminisce a bit when trapped in the prison.  Then saved the turtle arc for an couple of (longer) OVA\\'s.\\n\\nThe only character that would need a decent amount of introductory dialogue would be rishia - but it isn\\'t as though the full adaptation really gave her much of that either. , but then we wouldn\\'t know who this chucklefuck Kyo is or why he hates Naofumi\\'s guts. , Seems like Naofumi distinctly stopped her from doing the wierd noise, it happened last episode but she also stopped it too so I\\'m glad she knows it\\'s annoying.\\n\\nI still miss Ost though I thought she was beautiful and incredibly charming , And makes a lot less sense. , I want my Raphtalia to stay smol! For 10 episodes at least! , Kyo’s VA is doing a great job. They sure know how to make the character as unlikeable as possible lol. , Right, that’s kinda what I was thinking. This world is a lot more interesting. I hope they get to explore this world and all it has to offer a little more. , Thanks for letting me know, I\\'ll hop back on then. , Ight good looks. I don’t want to see her go through that shit she had to go through in the beginning. If I had to see that bs again, I’d lose my shit lmaoo , So have we gotten to the point of borderline hentai masqueraded as \"fan service\"? And to a child in a teenagers body, no less? Glad I stopped watching. , ...they are in another world. Nobody knows them. The masks are to keep people from bugging them for more items. , whatever helps you sleep at night. , I haven\\'t read the LN but in the manga, Naofumi doesn\\'t find out that Kyo set up the trap until later though. I like that it happens earlier since it heightens the stakes even more for Naofumi. , I actually thought he was on board with it because it was like the novel  which is good enough for me. But now with your comment i wonder , Skills don’t depend on level, they unlock when you unlock a certain shield. , Not even 30. Naofumi is level 9, you see all their levels when they walk through the forest. The rest of the party are in their 20\\'s , Got to a point where I would just skim through the episodes to get a general idea of what was happening , [deleted] , >Maybe it had something to do with her level being reset?\\n\\nThe others had their levels reset as well. , I feel like the answer is going to be some unsatisfying bullshit. , Kyo is much more dangerous than you think. , No, they\\'re handling this arc better than the previous one, pacing-wise. , my comment was laughing at how wrong they are , But the weapon can not hurt them. , The source is the light novel. I too like this arc because of her , Thank you! , Exactly , How does it make less sense though? It was explained perfectly. It\\'s just not the same way it happened in the LN. The stakes are higher here. And it\\'s much more personal. , No worries. Might not see smol Raphtalia again but you\\'ll get something better! , Yeah, episode 6 was a great finale to the turtle arc. And now episodes 7 and 8 are great and goes back to the roots of what made shield hero fun , Hopefully that doesn\\'t happen again. If it starts to follow the LN, she should have some badass scenes coming up. , Kyo knows them. He\\'s why they went into the portal in the first place. It\\'s one thing to be walking around the city at leisure, and it\\'s another to create a large crowd around you. , In the LN, I remember reading something about him hearing Kyo\\'s voice when going through the portal , He was 33 or something later in the episode, though. , That was before he got the XP from the Earth Crystal , I dropped the anime because of it. Is it good/decent again? , Ok , i seen before ppl hail this dude as best villain...\\n\\nSo all it have to be a good villain is have an annoying voice and a punching face? , Yup, I was really hoping Naofumi held her to the end, but I kind of understand. I really really hate Kyo and his butt boy, aren\\'t the others searching for him too? Maybe this will be where they find Filo and she fills Raph\\'s spot for a bit, next episode is humming fairy , [removed] , [removed] , impossible , It’s definitely a big step up from the first arc of the season. Still too soon to speak but from what I hear this arc is really good in the manga , Oh sorry, it seems you are a mod in /r/shieldbro, my apologies I didn\\'t mean to call out your ~~bad~~ taste. I-I\\'ll delete the post. , All the villains in shield hero are shit tbh, they are all the same but just increasingly more annoying and one dimensional. The author tried to give a story reason that they are all this way but it\\'s weak sauce reason at best. , The villains so far have been so…..petty. That and cartoonish. It’s kinda sad. , Sometimes it\\'s good to have a villain that the audience wants to see flayed alive and dipped into a cat of lemon juice. , I\\'m surprised they bothered separating Raphtalia after changing it up and though they did it in such a hamfisted way atleast things are sort of back on track. , No LN reader has an answer for you, everything so far has been anime original , Naofumi got Raphtalia stolen from him right before his eyes, as the culprit continued to gloat about it while Naofumi could do nothing but watch. How is that nor more personal? Compared to what happened in the LN it seemed like just a glitch in the portal. Even if Kyo tampered with the portal, it was just a means to separate them. In the anime, Kyo said he was going to do experiments on Raphtalia. Naofumi is going to be a helluva lot more worried for her safety and extremely pissed off the next time he sees Kyo\\'s face.  \\n\\n\\nAlso, trash 2 is not a pleb, and considering this was Kyo\\'s ploy, he is not far behind. The chances of her escaping from that situation is low. , Look forward to being pleasantly surprised next week. , I literally don\\'t care , heh , They made it better. , How far differs the LN from the anime? , Is it like two smol Raphtalia\\'s or one smol and one big? That\\'s only way to beat one smol Raph. , Anime has been rearranging sequence of events. Raphtalia wasn\\'t with Naofumi at this point in the LN. It was just Naofumi, Rishia, and Kizuna. , It\\'s taking a different route to the same destination , sacred timeline have been restored... somehwta'"
